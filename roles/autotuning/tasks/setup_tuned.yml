# With vm.swapiness=1 and vm.overcommit_memory=2, vm.overcommit_ratio should
# allow the system to use the entire memory available.
#
#                    RAM * vm.overcommit_ratio
# Max Alloc = SWAP + -------------------------
#                              100
#
# If we want to allow the system to allocate the entire memory (Max Alloc =
# RAM), then, overcommit_ratio is calculated as below:
#
#                        RAM - SWAP
# vm.overcommit_ratio = ------------ * 100
#                           RAM
#
# We ensure a minimum value of 50. This is usefull for the case when the amount
# of swap memory is ridiculous higher than the RAM size
