# setup_dbt2_driver

This role is for setting up a server for the
[DBT-2](https://www.github.com/osdldbt/dbt2) terminal emulators (a.k.a. the
driver) transaction manager.

This is required in a 3-tier or 2-tier client-server configurations.

## Requirements

Following are the requirements of this role.
  1. Ansible
  2. `edb_devops.edb_postgres` -> `setup_repo` role for setting the repository
     on the systems.

## Role Variables

When executing the role via ansible these are the required variables:

  * ***dbt2_version***

  These playbooks can install any version of DBT-2 that is packaged from GitHub.
  See the following link for available versions:
  https://github.com/osdldbt/dbt2-packaging/releases

  * ***dbttools_version***

  These playbooks can install any version of DBT Tools that is packaged from
  GitHub but specific versions may be required depending on the version of DBT-2
  used.  Unless you have a specific reason to install a specific version, you
  will generally want to use the latest avaialble versions.  See the following
  link for available versions:
  https://github.com/osdldbt/dbttools-packaging/releases

  * ***pg_owner***

  This is used to ensure the operating system user to use for running the DBT-2
  client is created.  For ease of autoamtion, this should be the same user that
  is defined for the `setup_dbt2` role.  A different default is set depending
  on which `vars` file is inherited, which is based on the PostgreSQL
  distribution selected.

These variables can be assigned in the `pre_tasks` definition of the
section: *How to include the `setup_dbt2_driver` role in your Playbook*.
