# setup_dbt2_client

This role is for setting up a server for the
[DBT-2](https://www.github.com/osdldbt/dbt2) client transaction manager.

This is required in a 3-tier client-server configuration.  If a 2-tier
client-server configuration is desired, this playbook can be skipped.  Only the
database and driver tier is needed in a 2-tier configuration.

## Requirements

Following are the requirements of this role.
  1. Ansible
  2. `edb_devops.edb_postgres` -> `setup_repo` role for setting the repository
     on the systems.

## Role Variables

When executing the role via ansible these are the required variables:

  * ***dbt2_client_port***

  This is the TCP/IP port that the DBT-2 client will listen to.  Unless there is
  a conflict with another application, there shouldn't be any reason to change
  this default.

  * ***dbt2_version***

  These playbooks can install any version of DBT-2 that is packaged from GitHub.
  See the following link for available versions:
  https://github.com/osdldbt/dbt2-packaging/releases

  * ***pg_version***

  Postgres Versions supported are: 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14

  * ***pg_dbt2_dbname***

  This is the database name to use specifically for the test.

  * ***pg_owner***

  This is used to ensure the operating system user to use for running the DBT-2
  client is created.  For ease of autoamtion, this should be the same user that
  is defined for the `setup_dbt2` role.  A different default is set depending
  on which `vars` file is inherited, which is based on the PostgreSQL
  distribution selected.

These variables can be assigned in the `pre_tasks` definition of the
section: *How to include the `setup_dbt2_client` role in your Playbook*.

## Example Playbook

### Inventory file content

Content of the `inventory.yml` file:

```yaml
all:
  children:
    dbt2_client:
      hosts:
        dbt2_client.dbt2.internal:
          ansible_host: 10.1.1.11
          private_ip: 10.1.1.11
```

### Playbook file content

Content of the `inventory.yml` file:

Below is an example of how to include the `setup_dbt2_client` role:

```yaml

- hosts: all
  name: Postgres deployment playbook for DBT-2 client.
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes
  any_errors_fatal: True
  max_fail_percentage: 0

  collections:
    - edb_devops.edb_postgres

  roles:
    - role: setup_repo
      when: "'setup_repo' in lookup('edb_devops.edb_postgres.supported_roles', wantlist=True)"
    - role: setup_dbt2_client
      when: "'setup_dbt2_client' in lookup('edb_devops.edb_postgres.supported_roles', wantlist=True)"
```

## Playbook execution examples

```bash
# To deploy community Postgres version 13 with the user centos
$ ansible-playbook playbook.yml \
